# Zotero and Databases

We tried to answer 2 questions in this weekâ€™s class to understand how does _Zotero_ citing program works. The first one is how does a computer process understand the structured data, and the second one is how does a database work.

Although the word *database* is familiar, I didn't know exactly what it meant. As I learned in class, a database is a developed archive that contains more than just basic pieces of information. The databases contain in it appropriate kinds of schemas which can communicate with computers easily. 

These definitions are important for us because of how different databases communicate. Since automatic citation programs communicate with databases. To better understand this process, we examined the logic behind it. Although I have always given my references manually, I am aware that this way is exhausting and boring. However, the computer-based method seemed complex until I learned about it.

I am planning to write an essay for this class. It would be more appropriate to use Zotero for the citations.  I need to challenge myself to improve my academic skills.
