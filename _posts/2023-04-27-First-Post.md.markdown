# Step by Step

## I am a bit **nervous**

In the lesson on April 20, 2023, we first learned about how an internet
address directs us and where it leads us. In addition, we found the
information useful that internet addresses start with *“http”* and then
have *“https”* added to them for security measures. The lesson explained
that the internet is essentially a reflection of computers communicating
with each other. Afterwards, we logged into the GitHub application,
which I had previously visited a couple of times but never looked at in
detail. It was explained that GitHub serves as **a kind of Dropbox** for
programmers. We all tried to create our own websites by opening a GitHub
account. We practiced how to create a blog using Jekyll’s code and how
to do coding through GitHub..

### What I Learned Until Now
