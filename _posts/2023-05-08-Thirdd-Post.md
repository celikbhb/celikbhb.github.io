# Default Header- Demo

 ## 08.05.2023
 
I tried to add pictures to my page, but I could not manage it. The problem was I only wrote the code in my markdown document. Jekyll couldn't find the image document from it. Then I added the picture's code manually, and upload the images in the image folder. Then, it is solved.

I managed it thanks to [this](/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oKO-7gsM4s) Youtube page. You can also from this video how can you add a header or how can you arrange a default header image for your posts.

>Let's see how did it go...
